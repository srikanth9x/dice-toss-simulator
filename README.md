#  Dice & Toss Simulator

A simple web app for rolling dice and flipping coins with fun color changes.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

**[Check it out: srikanth9x.github.io/dice-toss-simulator](https://srikanth9x.github.io/dice-toss-simulator)**

## What it does

- Roll a dice (1-6)
- Flip a coin (Heads or Tails)  
- Changes colors randomly every time you click
- Works great on phones

## Why I built this

I was following a tutorial that taught how to make a dice roller. After I got that working, I noticed there was empty space below it, so I thought "why not add a coin flip too?" Used the same logic and boom - now it does both.

This is just a fun practice project. Nothing fancy, just me learning and having fun with code.

## ðŸ“± Coded entirely on my phone

Yeah, you read that right. I wrote this whole thing on my smartphone - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, everything. That's why it works so well on mobile... because that's literally where I built and tested it!

Coding on a phone isn't easy, but it was a fun challenge.

## Built with

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the basics)
- Google Fonts for the Happy Monkey font
- My phone's code editor

## How the colors work

Every time you click either button, it generates a random color and then calculates the inverted color. One becomes the background, the other becomes the text color. Simple but looks cool!

## Development time

Built this in one afternoon to evening session. Nothing too serious, just wanted to practice and see what I could make.

## Future plans

Honestly, probably none. This was just for learning. I prefer working on projects that solve real problems, but this was good practice for the basics.

## Want to contribute?

This specific project is pretty much done, but I'm always working on bigger projects that actually solve real-world problems. Those are where I'd love collaborators!
